# Visual-3D-Print-Error-Detection
This repository is for a Course tittled "Learning from Images" at BHT. Our Project is to detect if a 3D-Print has failed with the help of Cameras,CNN and Domain shifting.

# Preface
This Idea ist not new and also has been done before but we and my colleague want to implent it ourself. We are trying to use an allready labeld Dataset from Kaggle where the Camera is directly mounted to the Nozzle which is maybe not Ideal for detecting failes of the whole Print but it could be used for first layer print fail detection. Furthermore we maybe gonna try to use a Cambridge Dataset which is more extensive.

# Camera Mount 
The Camera is how i allready mentioned directly mounted to the print-head via a 3D-Printed mount https://www.printables.com/de/model/17993-prusa-mk3s-55mm-nozzle-camera-mount 
This mount may be not the perfect mount for the camera postion and image we generate trough that. There are many alternatives on Printables and if none of them match our Requierments we could design one ourself 

# 3D-Printer
The Printing is done on one of our own upgraded Prusa MK3S+. As a Filament we gonna use White PLA from FilaFarm because it gives the best contrast to the green printbed and the gold like nozzle.
